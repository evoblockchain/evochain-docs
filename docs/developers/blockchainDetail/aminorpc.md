# JSON-AMINO-RPC Endpoint (Encoded by Amino)

## Amino vs JSON
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is human readable, well structured and great for interoperability with Javascript, but it is inefficient. Protobuf3, BER, RLP all exist because we need a more compact and efficient binary encoding standard. Amino provides efficient binary encoding for complex objects (e.g. embedded objects) that integrate naturally with your favorite modern programming language. Additionally, Amino has a fully compatible JSON encoding.
